| **Name**                               | What's the name and category?                            |
| **Problem Solved**                     | What type of problems can it solve?                      |
| **Technique**                          | Is it brute force, greedy, divide & conquer, etc.?       |
| **Time Complexity**                    | Best, average, worst-case analysis                       |
| **Space Complexity**                   | How much memory does it use?                             |
| **Base Case**                          | What’s the input where it stops or returns immediately?  |
| **Recursive Formula / Iterative Step** | How does it break down big problems into smaller ones?   |
| **Visualization**                      | Diagram or dry-run example                               |
| **Pseudocode**                         | High-level logic                                         |
